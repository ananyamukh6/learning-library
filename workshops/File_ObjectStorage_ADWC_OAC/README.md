# From files to Object Storage, then to ADWC and OAC                                    

When you need a visualization and want to keep up with the data source updates, Oracle provides the perfect tools, all you need to do is to link them together. This workshop walks you through all the steps to set up the pipeline. In order to get started, you will need to provision a **Virtual Machine (VM)**, **Oracle Object Storage**, **Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW)**, **Oracle Autonomous Analytic Cloud Service (OAC)** (or using local **Oracle Data Visualization Desktop (DVD)** free with the purchase of ADW service). Information about how to provision those instances can be found inside upper level workshop folders.

A typical workflow contains 3 steps:
1. Obtain the data from various resources and upload it into object storage, this step can be automated through scheduling a script job in VM;  
2. Load the data from object storage into ADWC, this step can be automated through scheduling a notebook job in ADWC; 
3. Refresh the visualization in OAC or DVD to reflect the data updates in ADWC. 

##Move data from various sources to ADWC

##Loading data to ADWC from object storage
We have already seen in ?? how to provision Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADWC). In this section we will focus on how to get data to ADWC from object storage without any human intervention.

We have already seen how to set up an object storage and load data into it in the previous section. Once the data files are updated in object storage we need to construct the URLs of the files and an object store auth token. Refer Steps 7-9 Under Setup the OCI Object Store (https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/workshops/journey4-adwc/?page=LabGuide3.md)

Now we go to our ADWC instance service console and go to our ML notebook. If you need help creating an Oracle ML note book please refer to (https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/workshops/journey4-adwc/?page=LabGuide8.md).

We have 2 users "ADMIN" and "OMLUSER1". We use the "OMLUSER1" for the further steps. We cannot use "ADMIN" for any of the below steps. 

![](images/OMLusers.png)

Now we run the below script in Oracle ML notebook as OMLUSER1 to load the data automatically from Object Storage to ADWC.

The datya is now loaded in ADWC. We will create a job in our ML notebook to automate this loading process. 
The steps for scheduling a data load to ADWC are shown below.
- Click on Jobs under Quick Actions
- The job creation window opens and now click on create
-Finally click on "OK" and a new scheduled job is created.







## Goals for this workshop

 - Get comfortable with Oracle's public cloud services
 - Load data into the object store
 - Load data from the object store
 - Use Oracle Machine Learning SQL notebooks
 - Schedule SQL notebook job
 - Use Oracle Analytics CLoud (OAC) with ADW
 - Use Oracle Data Visualization Desktop (DVD) with ADW
